Curated list of information retrieval and web search resources from all around the web.
## Introduction
[Information Retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval) involves finding relevant information for user queries, ranging from simple domain of database search to complicated aspects of web search (Eg - Google, Bing, Yahoo). Currently, researchers are developing algorithms to address [Information Need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_needs) of user(s), by maximizing [User and Topic Relevance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance_(information_retrieval)) of retrieved results, while minimizing [Information Overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload) and retrieval time.
